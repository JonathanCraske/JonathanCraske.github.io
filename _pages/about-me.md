Introduction paragraph goes there


## Sports & Recreation
As a devotee of many Canadian stereotypes, I grew up playing ice hockey competitive as a goalie. I am a 2-time GTHL City Champion (2007, 2008), Bantam All-Star (2010), 4-time TDSB City Champion, and 2-time McGill Intramural Champion. As a fan, I lead a life of martyrdom as a supporter of the Toronto Maple Leafs. During my time at USC, I took advantage of the comparably cheap tickets and attended several LA Kings games, often to cheer for visiting teams. I grew up idolizing Curtis Joseph, Patrick Roy, Roberto Luongo, and Marc-Andre Fleury.

I am also an avid runner. I have completed several half-marathons while living in LA, and as part of my local run club will be competing in the coveted TSP - an unsactioned relay race from the Santa Monica pier to Las Vegas - as well as the Big Sur International Marathon.


## Music
Music has always been a big part of my life, beginning with my discovery of my Dad's CD collection when I was 6, followed quickly by lessons in how fragile CDs are. I have engaged this interest through a number of channels despite my decided lack of talent. I have played in a number of orchestras, stage bands, and indie groups as a saxophone player, guitarist, bassist, and drummer to varying degrees of success. Unsurprisingly, all groups seemed to find success shortly after my departure.

I began collecting records with a purchase of David Bowie's "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars" in 2008, and have since accumulated over 200 records. Feel free to peruse and pass judgement on my collection listed here.

I previously served as a member of the board of directors for Wavelength, Toronto's longest running independent music festival, and continue to enjoy going to live shows whenever possible.


## Cooking & Food
As my physique suggests, food is a big part of my life. Growing up in a half-Italian household, I learned to cook at an early age, and it's something that still brings me great joy.

I enjoy cooking traditional southern-Italian dishes (including and especially fresh pasta), Canadian delicacies (Butter Tarts), and a multitude of other cuisines.

While in LA, I primarily relied on the city's exceptional street-food culture as a means through which to explore. Specifically, I rely on cheeseburgers to guide me anytime I visit a new city - recommendations are always welcome!
